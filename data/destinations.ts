      "Weber County, with its bustling railroad hub and the orderly flow of the Ogden River, is a place of systems and connections. The conductor of this complex orchestra is Otis, the Badger. A bit gruff but always fair, he ensures everything runs on time, from the trains to the seasons.",
      "Otis is a Law and Order Mentor. With his eternal lantern, he inspects the tunnels and foundations of the city, making sure the systems are strong. He teaches that rules and structure, like railroad tracks, provide the path for powerful things to happen safely and efficiently."
